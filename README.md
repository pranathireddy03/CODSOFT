TO-DO-LIST:
Certainly! This code uses Python's Tkinter library to create a visual to-do list application. It builds a window with a list area, an entry field to add tasks, and buttons to add and delete tasks.

When you run the code, it generates a window where you can input tasks in the provided field and click the "Add task" button to add them to the list. The tasks appear in the list, and if you select any task and click the "Delete task" button, it removes the selected task from the list.

Overall, it's a simple to-do list interface that allows users to manage tasks by adding and deleting them through a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python.
