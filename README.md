TO-DO-LIST:
Certainly! This code uses Python's Tkinter library to create a visual to-do list application. It builds a window with a list area, an entry field to add tasks, and buttons to add and delete tasks.

When you run the code, it generates a window where you can input tasks in the provided field and click the "Add task" button to add them to the list. The tasks appear in the list, and if you select any task and click the "Delete task" button, it removes the selected task from the list.

Overall, it's a simple to-do list interface that allows users to manage tasks by adding and deleting them through a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python.


PASSWORD GENERATOR:
Absolutely! This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a password generator application with a graphical interface.

Upon execution, a window appears titled "Password Generator." The interface consists of two main sections:

Password Length Section:

This section has a label "Password Length:" and an entry field next to it.
Users can input the desired length for their password into this entry field.
Generated Password Section:

Below the length section, there's a "Generate Password" button.
Once users input a valid length and click the button, it triggers the password generation function.
The generated password appears in an entry field labeled "Generated Password."
The password generation function creates a password based on the length specified by the user. It utilizes a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

Overall, this application allows users to specify the length of a password they want and generates a secure random password accordingly, displaying it within the interface for easy access.
